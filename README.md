# PyhtonChallenges
Coding Challenges for learning Python 
I currently only do challenges on [CheckIo](https://py.checkio.org) which is a handy website for sharing and solving coding challenges for python and ts.

## What?
I have to learn how to use Python as soon and as quickly as possible cuz my studies for artificial intelligence will start soon and I don't know anything about that language

## How?
I use the IPython Notebook format which is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. For more details on the Jupyter Notebook, please see the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) website.

It basically makes solving challenges in vscode a breeze without adding any more complexity to the workflow, except having to copy the code over to the [CheckIo](https://py.checkio.org) page again and clicking on solve. (But tbh if that's a big deal for you what the fuck are you doing here)
